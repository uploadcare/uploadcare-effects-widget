Effects Tab provides 9 effects for on-the-fly image editing on upload:
crop, rotate, mirror, flip, blur, sharpen, enhance, grayscale and invert.
You can customize which effects are allowed and otherwise affect the tab behavior.

## How it works

Image operations provided by Effects Tab are based on the capabilities of our [CDN API][uc-cdn].
The tab outputs a CDN link holding your image [UUID][uc-uuid] and
[image operations][uc-cdn-image-operations] applied by a user during the in-tab editing process.
Technically, every original image is firstly uploaded to our CDN and then shown
to a user in Effects Tab.
In case of uploading [multiple files][uc-multi-upload], this happens asynchronously.

For example, if a user chose to apply `grayscale` and clicked `rotate` once,
this is how the output value looks like:

```
https://ucarecdn.com/:UUID/-/preview/-/grayscale/-/rotate/270/
```

You will always have the `preview` operation in Effects Tab output URL due to
CDN API [limitations][uc-cdn-limits].

## Requirements

Since Effects Tab is a [custom tab][uc-custom-tabs] for Uploadcare Widget,
make sure to start with [installing the widget][uc-widget-install].

## Install

Youâ€™re free to choose from the install methods listed below.

### NPM

Get Effects Tab:

```
npm i uploadcare-widget-tab-effects --save
```

And then import it in your module:

```javascript
import uploadcareTabEffects from 'uploadcare-widget-tab-effects'
```

### CDN

You can either install this minification-enabled Effects Tab version:

```html
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget-tab-effects/1.x/uploadcare.tab-effects.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

Or a bundled version without minification:

```html
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget-tab-effects/1.x/uploadcare.tab-effects.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

## Usage

Thatâ€™s how you add Effects Tab to the widget:

```javascript
uploadcare.registerTab('preview', uploadcareTabEffects)
```

## Configuration

This section describes different ways to set which effects are allowed
in the Effects Tab.

### Global variables

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_EFFECTS = 'blur,sharp,grayscale'
</script>
```

or

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_EFFECTS = ['blur', 'sharp', 'grayscale']
</script>
```

### Local attributes

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" name="content"
  data-effects="blur,sharp,grayscale"
/>
```

### Settings object

```javascript
uploadcare.start({
  effects: 'blur,sharp,grayscale',
})
```

or

```javascript
uploadcare.start({
  effects: ['blur', 'sharp', 'grayscale'],
})
```

## Options

### Effects `string|array`

Global: `UPLOADCARE_EFFECTS` <br>
Local: `data-effects` <br>
Object key: `effects` <br>

Default value: `crop,rotate,enhance,sharp,grayscale`.

This allows you to configure the set of enabled effects.
It also controls **the order of effects** in the tab:
however, `crop` is always the first in the set.

`effects` can either be a string holding one or more
comma-separated effects or an array of strings (JS only).
You can also enable all effects by setting the option to `all`.

Available effects:

* `crop` â€” crops images freely or using set aspect ratios
* `rotate` â€” rotates images
* `mirror` â€” provides image-mirroring capabilities
* `flip` â€” allows flipping images
* `blur` â€” filters images via Gaussian Blur
* `sharp` â€” allows adjusting image sharpness
* `enhance` â€” makes images look better via auto
  levels, auto contrast, and saturation sharpening
* `grayscale` â€” desaturates images
* `invert` â€” inverts image colors

## Localization

Itâ€™s possible your locale is not available in the tab yet.
If thatâ€™s the case, contributing your locale might be a good idea.
This can be done by forking the
[main repository](https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-widget-tab-effects)
followed by adding a new localization file
[here](https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-widget-tab-effects/tree/master/src/locale).
